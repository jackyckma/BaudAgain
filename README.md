# 🖥️ BaudAgain: AI-Enhanced Bulletin Board System

> *"Bringing back the intimate, decentralized communities of the dial-up era — with an AI soul."*

**Hackathon:** Kiroween (kiroween.devpost.com)  
**Category:** Resurrection — Bring your favorite dead technology back to life

## Overview

BaudAgain resurrects the Bulletin Board System (BBS) experience from the dial-up era, enhanced with modern AI capabilities. Host your own BBS as a simple web service, featuring:

- 🤖 **AI-Powered SysOp** - An AI agent that welcomes users, answers questions, and helps manage your community
- 🎮 **AI Door Games** - Dynamic text adventures powered by AI (starting with "The Oracle" fortune teller)
- 💬 **Message Bases** - Classic threaded discussion forums
- 🎨 **ANSI Art** - Authentic retro terminal aesthetics
- ⚙️ **AI Configuration** - Configure your BBS by talking to the AI assistant

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- Anthropic API key (for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd BaudAgain
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development (all services)
npm run dev

# Development (individual services)
npm run dev:server      # BBS server only
npm run dev:terminal    # Terminal client only
npm run dev:panel       # Control panel only

# Build
npm run build

# Test
npm run test

# Clean
npm run clean           # Remove all node_modules
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch -w server
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize your BBS:

- **BBS name and theme** - Personalize your board
- **AI personality** - Customize the AI SysOp's character
- **Message bases** - Add/remove discussion forums
- **Door games** - Enable/disable games
- **Security settings** - Rate limits, timeouts, etc.

Or use the **AI Configuration Assistant** in the control panel to configure via natural language!
